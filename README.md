It is an SDE Internship Assignment.
SetUp for running the project:
Make sure you have Node.js v16,npm,MongoDB installed in your machine.

Frontend: Frontend is built using React and it is the UI that interacts with the user. It displays data in the form of tables and accepts user inputs for creating, editing and deleting contacts.It also API requests to backend for saving and updating the user's information.
Backend: Backend is used to write business logic and validation. It will validate data before sending it to the database and checks for duplicate emails. Here the CRUD operations are performed.
Database: MongoDB suits perfectly for this project as it is schema less structure and can easily handle large data volumes as the entries increases. We can expand the entries using MongoDB. It gets integrated well with React and Node.js
